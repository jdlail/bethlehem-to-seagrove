Jack is born in a partial log cabine into a large farming family in Alexander County. It is the height of the Great Depression, and the same year the family farm is lost to foreclosure, setting the stage for a life built on hard work and perseverance.

### 1939 — The School Years Begin

Starts first grade at Bethlehem School. Life is centered around Duke Power rental farm and later the "Bowman Farm." The daily rhythms of living on a farm in a rural area instill early lessons in the value of community and family.

### 1952 – 1956 — Navy Service & Global Horizons

Enlists in the U.S. Navy and trains as an aviation electrician. His service inlcuded being assigned to a project involving a new plane being developed for the Navy. He was on a flight in a test plane that crashed on landing. Jack describes the harrowing experience of the plane hitting a structure at 80 miles per hour, which "sheared the wings off" and left the fuselage as the only part remaining. Remarkably, Jack and the others survived the impact. He later was deployed aboard aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean. This service broadens his perspective and provides the technical foundation for his future career.
