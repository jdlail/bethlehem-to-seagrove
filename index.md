### Bethlehem... to Seagrove

Jack Columbus Lail is quiet, unassuming, and slow to speak but careful to listen. Yet, he is an influential entrepreneur and community leader who founded Mid-State Plastics and shaped Randolph County for decades.

This memoir captures his 93-year journey—from his roots in the farming community of Bethlehem during the Great Depression to his success in Seagrove. It is a story of resilience, integrity, and a life dedicated to his family, his community, and the employees who made his success possible.

**Coming March 2026 to Amazon in Paperback and Kindle.**
